Ever lost your local version of a website? Ever wish you had stored an earlier version after making a change?

From today you can download the source files for any version of your website you've ever hosted on BitBalloon.

<!-- excerpt -->

Just go to the **History** tab when viewing one of your sites in the admin backend. Next to each deploy you'll find a new **Download** button that will let you download a zip with all the original source files you uploaded for that deploy.
