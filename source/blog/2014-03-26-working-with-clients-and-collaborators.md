![User Management Panel](/images/posts/user-panel.png)

Most websites have a group of people involved in building, updating and maintaining them.

This is no different with static sites or one-page apps, and so far BitBalloon hasn't been giving the ideal experience for a team working together or for a designer with a client.

<!-- excerpt -->

Today we're happy to announce our new user management feature.

Now inviting clients or collaborators to your site is as easy as typing their emails in a textbox. We'll send them an invitation and when they follow the confirmation link they get access to the site.

Never share an FTP password again!
