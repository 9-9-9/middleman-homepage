## Security @ BitBalloon

One of the reasons for going with a static website hosted on BitBalloon is security. Static sites have no moving parts and don't need constant updating to avoid virus installs or defacement.

Security is an important issue for us and we're always working hard to make sure our own applications and infrastructure follow security best practices.

## Responsible Disclosure

While we run a tight ship and monitor our infrastructure carefully, any public facing service suffer some level of security vulnerabilities at some point.

Our team appreciates the work of security researchers and their efforts to keep our community safe. We want to promote responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities and provide a means for you to share information with us.

Responsible disclosure includes:

* Giving BitBalloon a reasonable amount of time to fix an issue before you publish it.
* Making a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, the destruction of data or interruption of service.
* Follow these rules, and we'll thank you.

At this time, we are offering to publish the names and link out to whitehats who have helped BitBalloon realize and fix security bugs. At some point in the future, we may retroactively reward all Whitehats. We may also institute an official bounty program at any time.

## Policy Exclusions

This list is not necessarily complete. We evaluate all reports on a case-by-case basis.

* Denial of Service vulnerabilities
* Spam or Social Engineering techniques
* Non-security related bugs

## How to Disclose

You can disclose a vulnerability by emailing [security@bitballoon.com](mailto:security@bitballoon.com).

Please encrypt your mails if they include sensitive information or proof of concept exploits.
